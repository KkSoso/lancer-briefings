Kari Bacho. Noble.

At least, she was.

Kari grew up hunting for sport, finding the most vicious ways to eliminate local megafauna - and megaflora - while leaving their best features intact as trophies. She turned to creating specialized weapons and a silent flight suit, hunting snipes, and contrastingly dominating the local ballrooms. Either she's the center of attention or she's nearly as hard to locate as Grim.

Her weapon selection is housed within a core gun frame, with any mounts allowing for interchangeable extensions.
