## If the Suit Fits
What in a blazing hypergiant was that? The newbie showed her inside stuff stayed on the inside, but there are a lot of ashes you're making for Phoenix to rise from. Are you sure she's fit for a metal suit? The intel on this is the best yet for your talents, Redcoat.

# Major Goal
- Major: Infiltrate the primary supply carrier and modify the pilot logs to requisition the open mech licenses.

# Other Goals
- Minor 1: Dispose of the former upcoming pilots.
- Minor 2: Modify the shipping ledger to exclude intake of the current mech models.
- Incidental:
  - Avoid unnecessary detection that could recreate you to authorities.
  - Avoid collateral damage to the carrier's engines.
  - Clear at least one of their shuttles for your egress.
  - Cause as much damage as possible under guise of generic piracy.
  - Paint the local crimelord logo across the cargo hold.
  - Claim or eject the cargo hold contents.

# Stakes
- Time is critical.
  - If the restored crew can biolink with their mech licenses, you're cannon fodder at best.
  - If our target makes it through the blink gate before you're off the ship, you're on the next prison frigate Cradle forgot to regulate.

# Reserves
- Every crewmember shall wear a space-safe undersuit containing a four-hour emergency flare. If you're out there longer than that or are nearing capture by Harrison Armory suppliers, it would be better to remove your helmet.
- Blueprints of the larger shuttles.
