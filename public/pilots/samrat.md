Amedee Sanmiguel. Starship pilot.

Amedee started life as a respectable member of the Union's Finest. Which Finest, he's never clear on. He cites laws that the Third Committee don't entirely back up, but neither would their older officers refute.

Prying any details about a law out of him is as tricky as hearing about his younger siblings. They'd joined the military to follow in his stead despite his efforts to provide them with Manna for a better life. To avoid splash damage, he held back on a detonator charge when they believed an encampment to be filled with civilians. He had to activate the charges to provide mercy to what was left of his family and crew.

He's never hesitated to pull the trigger since.

He is never without his visor. Even in the communal showers. It isn't waterproof, yet he always knows when someone is nearby even when he has to fix it. There are constant rumors of what lies beneath - especially with how nervous he gets about the Atlas Line.
