Xiang Juan Sweeting. Criminal.

She always wants to set a good example.

If only life would give her a chance. That is, if it had any chances left to give, and if she weren't constantly taking those chances early from those she believes are less deserving. A food chain is circumstantial at best, and isn't inclined to remain stable for long. Especially not with technology involved. Xiang believes that second chances are what people earn when someone else forgets to twist the knife, and would rather stab harder than be seen as anything but the best.

After all, anyone below the top of the food chain gets hunted by the top.

And the top of the food chain gets hunted by the rest.
