# Mission // #000
## Shuttle Rubble
This is it, Redcoat, your big chance to wear the shiny boots. You wanted an upgrade from this life, you've got it. Stealth is optional but recommended. Loud can still work, depending on where you do it.

# Major Goal
- Gain the navigation data for the carrier from the supply vessel.
- Activate the emergency beacon for the carrier's auxiliary ships.

# Other Goals
- Incidental:
  - Infiltrate the support supply vessel without allowing any signal to the main carrier.
  - Avoid collateral damage to the supply vessel's primary engines.
  - Claim their shipping supplies - food, cold-fusion engines, and life support system parts.
  - The harder it is to trace back to us, the easier we will have it if those auxiliary ships make it back before our main objective is complete.

# Stakes
- Low on target, high on results.
  - This is a supply vessel. Expect a scattered crew, basic energy pistols, and competency mostly from a pilot and any engineers.
  - The data gained from this vessel is essential for our heist. Not getting caught now is critical to the next step and exponentially influential.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
