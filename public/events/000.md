The company's next big gig is on the way. With new member Phoenix in tow, and Pilot licenses on the line, what's to stop them from assembling a far greater pirate team than before?

That is, if quarrels and rising tension don't get the better of them.

Caviar's replaced throat can't hold off vocal detection software forever, and he keeps side-eying Grim. Confused? Nervous? Flustered?

Fullmoon has had several private conversations with the Captain since Redcoat brought the crew aboard, and Fullmoon's not integrating as well as the company would like.

Grim hasn't been the life of the party since Sapphire arrived, not that her actions have ever made perfect sense. Her focus on the gig has gained far too great traction for someone who says they're merely eager to feel what a mech is like.

Myrmidon can't sit still. Not just from a horrid malnutrition bout, either. The way she's constantly down the barrel of Sapphire, and hardly seems upset by the prospect, isn't resting well with any of the remaining company.

Samrat's been itching to try out Caviar's "new" inventions of warfare. His accidental-slaughter count is barely ten percent over average, but gathering information with him around has grown difficult.

Sapphire refuses to leave her weapon behind, even for an instant. Too many people were burning around her when Redcoat pulled both Myrmidon and Sapphire from the remains of their Pyrrhic conquest for revenge.
