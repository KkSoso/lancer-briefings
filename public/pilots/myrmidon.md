Anicet Michelet-Dejardin. Penal colonist. Formerly.

She knows how to start a riot. She also knows how to use a riot to distract from what she really wants. Once she got the keys to her new ride, she didn't know how far it wouldn't take her. She did know how to set off an alarm like a colonist in distress, how to look like one until the boarding party arrived, and how to cram her starving frame into their armor and use the last of the fuel to slingshot her way to the next craft. And the next. Eventually, she found a name that wasn't in a database, and has been struggling to veil her thick accent ever since.
