Kari Bacho. Noble.

At least, she was.

Kari grew up hunting for sport, finding the most vicious ways to eliminate local megafauna - and megaflora - while leaving their best features intact as trophies. She turned to creating specialized weapons and a silent flight suit, hunting snipes, and contrastingly dominating the local ballrooms. Either she's the center of attention or she's nearly as hard to locate as Grim. She stumbled into a battle zone, pulled apart a ship with all but one crewmember long dead, and gained an indentured servant to whom she now assigns all non-essential labor and responsibilities. However, she fears Myrmidon will leave any day, never to return.

Her weapon selection is housed within a core gun frame, with any mounts allowing for interchangeable extensions.
