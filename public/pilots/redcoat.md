Some wars are fought by soldiers, some by conscripts, and sometimes by those willing to die for their home. In very rare cases, though, those armies consist of the truest form of professionals. People raised and brought up for the sole purpose of being better than their peers and knowing how to act like it. Reginald Eval was one such person.

Born on the grassy moon of Concordia, the capital of a local trade family, Reginald was shown the way of the True Soldier from a young age. His father and grandfather had both served the Royal Guard Corps, and so Reginald would too. He actually became one of their best. He learned every way to fight, but also how to walk around a gala covered in marble pillars. Eventually, he was granted the right to join as escort detail for the royal family themselves. In his mech, he was their most powerful guardian.

It was unfortunate that Reginald had gotten his mech's sensors upgraded, allowing him to accidentally catch a snippet of conversation from the ruling family's teenage daughter in which she revealed Reginald's family had been bred specifically to be their personal guard, and nothing more. That when his contract expired in ten years, he'd be shot. And replaced.

It was equally unfortunate that pirates attacked that day. The local system was shocked when the esteemed Royal Guard failed, and the princess to their empire was gone. Nobody bothered to ask what happened to the best warrior the Corps had ever produced. He wasn't worth the effort.

One month later, a very familiar mech would be seen in new paint, with its old red cloth having been ripped off. So, Reginald began to make a name for himself as a mercenary. He never told anyone of his past, just proved himself time and again through his prowess with a building-sized rifle alone. Yet, he knew he couldn't go it solo forever. So, he made a crew. A new family to protect.

And one day, as he stopped to work out a deal with a client in some nameless colony's spaceport diner, he met a woman that peaked his interest. He hadn't seen someone with that kind of fire since the day his own eyes reflected in the digital display of his mech as pirates boarded a sparkling trade barge.

Reginald took her in, and found that she had a fire he desparately needed. Not out of love, a concept that Reginald scarcely understands or believes in, but out of sheer kinship. He needed someone to challenge him again, to prove that he could have a purpose beyond walking in old shoes without a goal. Now, he has a new one: give her the life he never had.

But he'll never tell her that. No, right now she needs to shine her boots or else she won't look presentable. After that comes the sparring practice, and then ironing tomorrow's dress jacket. Not that she'll wear it anyway.
